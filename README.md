The code is used in the paper: Gray-Zone Simulation of the Convective Boundary Layer Using Fourier Neural Operator. The work is built upon the pioneering works by Li et al. (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2010.08895) and Li et al. (https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0158830).
The dataset for training and testing, and the trained model (the .pth weight file) can be downloaded at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17301222.
